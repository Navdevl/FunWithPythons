Welcome to Python Magic
=====================


This simple **CODE** has two functions and they are doing great. First let me explain you the functionalities before saying the necessary things to install.

**1.** Determine if a word can be formed using the letters given to you.
Example: "okay" can be formed from this letter collections "ykieao"

**2.** Now, Lets take our first function to a next level by handling **Wild Character (?)**
Example: "mouse" can be formed from this letter collections "??sufe"

**3.** Now we are taking this to ultimate level of programming. We given a dictionary file and our mission is to find the matching words as per **1** , but the twist in our show is, we need to find the **longest string** among the few strings that matches our constraint. Wild characters are also included.

Dependencies
-------------
###1. Click
>> Click is a Python package for creating beautiful command line interfaces in a composable way with as little code as necessary. Blah blah blah.! In short, I played with these modules to achieve bonus points. 

###2. PyTest
>>The pytest framework makes it easy to write small tests, yet scales to support complex functional testing for applications and libraries.



Installation
-------------
To install from my source
> python setup.py install


Usage
--------------------
*P.S If you forgot what are the functionalities, scroll above. I gave a good explanation*

**To play with first functionality.**
>magic -s "edzlatsh" -w "hazel"
>> Output: Yes, "hazel" can be created.

**To play with second one.**
>magic -s "hoi??tri" -w "rotti"
>> Output: Yes, "rotti" can be created.

Explanation for Second One. **['r' , 'o' , 't' , 'i']** already exists but one character **['t']** doesn't exist. But wildcharacter come into scene and played it's role. So we handled the character and returns a true statement.

**To play with third one.**
>longest -s "uruqrnytrois"
>>turquois

According to the given dictionary, the results change for the third one.


Thank You

**Mrs.Swathi,**
		I would like to thank you for helping me and guiding me through this process. Still, I got a lot of things to learn and optimize the code further. But this new exposure and experience helped me to understand and code better. And I wanted to say this as a form of appreciation. I never ever met any person who could be in such high position and standards, but still could spend lot of time to learn and motivate people. Well, all those emails replied with the speed of BARRY ALLEN are one of the best things I ever had. Thank you again, Mam.
